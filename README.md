# articles_summary
this is a python program written in jupyter notebook to provide summary of any article.
URL of the article has to be entered and with the help of nltk library, the frequency distribution graph is plotted.
my project makes use of the paragraph tag in html to get into the content in any article, that is where most of the information is usually placed.
Can be used to provide an overview of the article in e-newspapers.

ensure you have installed nltk, bs4 and requests library before running the code in your environment.
